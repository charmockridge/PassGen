# Password Generator
A Python 3.7.3 command-line application. It generates a strong password to the user's desire length. This script will be used in the future, imported into a password storage application.

## What I learned
* The use of the module random to generate a random integer which can be used for indexing, in this case.
* A better understanding regarding the string module.
* The use of any() to determine if any element from one list appears in another list.
